# clr-check-perl-modules

This tool checks paths where Perl modules may have been installed, reporting
any that are left from a previous version. It reports separately those legacy
paths that are still supported by the current Perl configuration and those
legacy paths that *are not* supported.

Run `clr-check-perl-modules`.
